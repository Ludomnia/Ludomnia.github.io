<h1 class="titoletti">Let's make a Character!</h1>
<p class="testogenerico">
In this page we will show you a different (and possibly more fun) way to make a character, using as a base the Cypher System Rulebook:</p>
	<ol>
	<li><b>The stats:</b> every character starts with 34 stats point to divide among Strenght, Speed and
	Intellect, with no limits regarding the distribution except for the cap at 20 points. </li>

	<li><b>Edge:</b> every character gets one edge point at the start to place in the stat they prefer.
	<br><b style="color:red">Attention!</b> If you also accept the burden of a weakness in a stat (a -1 edge in a stat) you can get an
	additional point of edge where you prefer.</li>

	<li><b>Effort:</b> all characters start with one level of effort</li>
				
	<li><b>Special Abilities:</b> the special abilities in our system work based of slots:
	a high tier will need 3 slots, a mid tier 2 slot and a low tier 1 slot.
	At tier 1 you start with 4 slots that you can manage however you want.
	For example you could buy one high tier and one low tier, or two mid tiers.</li>
	
	<li><b>Cyphers:</b> a character can carry as many as 3 cyphers at one time<br>
	<b style="color:red">Attention!</b> Choosing to give up one or even two slots for cyphers will reward you with 1 or 2 more slots for
	your special abilities.</li>
	
	<li><b>Weapons:</b> a character can use all kind of weapons or decide to give up certain kinds
	to get additional special abilities slot. For every kind you give up you'll get 1 additional special ability slot.
	To be able to use that weapon kind again you must pay a penalty.</li>	
	
	<li><b>Stats Bonuses:</b> character can have a +4 or a +2 in evry stats but this will influence the amount of
	slot for the skills (yes, skills too use a slot system).</li>

	<li><b>Skills: </b> as said before, skills too have a slot based system,
	that can be used to buy narrow or broad skills. Narrow skills cost only one slot
	while the broad skills (being a collection of multiple narrow skills) cost 2 slots.
	Getting a +2 in the stats will reward you 2 skill slots, while getting the +4 grants 2 slots.</li>

	<li><b>Inability: </b>if you decide to accept an inability in a skill you'll be granted another skill slot.
	This "conversion" can only be done twice, granting a maximum of two extra slots</li>
