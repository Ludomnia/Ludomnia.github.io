<h1 class="titoletti">Let's make a Character!</h1>
<p class="testogenerico">
We opted to change the traditional way the cypher system works. There are no classes within our system, so the phrase ("I am a 'adjective' 'noun' who 'verbs'") is kind of useless.
We decided to create a more free way to manage your character:</p>
	<ol>
	<li><b>The Stats:</b> every character starts with 34 Stats point to divide among Strenght, Speed and
	Intellect. There are no limits on how you can distribute them, except for the maximum cap at 20 points each. </li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Edge:</b> everyone starts with one edge point to place in a stat of your choosing.
	<br><b style="color:red">Attention!</b> If you accept the burden of a weakness in a stat you can get an
	additional point of edge where you want. Weakness is a -1 edge, which will make you pay an additional point when you're
        spending points in that Stat</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Effort:</b> a characters start with one level of effort (if they start at level one)</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Special Abilities:</b> instead of the traditional system we found a new way to manage the special abilities:
	slots! Every special ability requires a different amount of slots depending on the tier:
	a low tier ability costs 1 slot, mid tier 2 slot and an high tier 3 slot. At tier 1 you start with 4 slots that you can manage
	in various ways, for example you could buy one high tier and one low tier, or two mid tiers.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Aggiungere focus</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Cyphers:</b> a character can carry as many as 3 cyphers<br>
	<b style="color:red">Attention! </b>For each cypher you renounce you can get 1 more slot for
	your special abilities.</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Weapons:</b> a character can use all kind of weapons (light, medium or heavy). For each weapon
	category you renounce you can get 1 additional special ability slot. You can't renounce a weapon category without giving up
	its heavier category too (for example, if you give up medium weapons you must renounce heavy weapons too).
	To be able to use once again the weapons you renounced you will need to pay the penalty (it's price will be one tier more
	than the usual price).</li>	
	<br>
	<li><b>Stats Bonuses:</b> character can have a +4 or a +2 to divide among the Stats but this will influence the amount of
	slot for the skills you will get later.</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Skills: </b> using a similar system to the Special abilities, the Skills have a slot based system too,
	which you can use to buy narrow or broad skills.A narrow skill (since it's limited) costs only one slot
	while a broad skill (being a collection of multiple narrow skills) costs 2 slots.
	Getting a +2 in the Stats you obtain 2 skill slots, while getting the +4 grants you 2 slots.</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>Inability: </b>accepting to get inability in a skill will grant you another skill slot.
	You can do this "conversion" only twice, granting you two extra slots</li>
