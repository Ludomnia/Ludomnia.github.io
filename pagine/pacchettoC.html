<h1 class="titoletti">Let's make a Character!</h1>
<p class="testogenerico">
To begin with we opted to change the tradition way the cypher system works. With our system there are no classes, so the phrase is kind of useless.
We decided to create a way to manage your character even more freely:</p>
	<ol>
	<li><b>The stats:</b> every character starts with 34 stats point to divide among Strenght, Speed and
	Intellect and there are no limits on how you can distribute them, except for the maximum cap at 20 points. </li>

	<li><b>Edge:</b> everyone get one edge point at the start to place where they want.
	<br><b style="color:red">Attention!</b> If you accept the burden of a weakness in a stat (so a -1 edge) you can get an
	additional point of edge in a stat of your choosing</li>

	<li><b>Effort:</b> a character start with one level of effort (if it starts at level one)</li>

	<li><b>Special Abilities:</b> contrary to the classic system we found a new way to manage the special abilities:
	slots! Every special ability requires a different amount of slots depending on the tier:
	a low tier is 1 slot, mid is 2 slot and high tier is 3 slot. At tier 1 you start with 4 slots that you can manage
	in various ways, for example you could buy one high tier and one low tier, or two mid tiers.</li>
	
	<li><b>Cyphers:</b> a character can carry as many as 3 cyphers<br>
	<b style="color:red">Attention!</b> Renouncing one or even two slots for cyphers you can get 1 or 2 more slots for
	your special abilities.</li>
	
	<li><b>Weapons:</b> a character can use all kind of weapons or decide to give up certain kinds
	of weapons to get additional special abilities slot. For every kind you give up you can get 1 additional slot.
	To once again be able to use the weapons you renounced you will need to pay the penalty.</li>	
	
	<li><b>Stats Bonuses:</b> character can have a +4 or a +2 in evry stats but this will inflounce the amount of
	slot for the skills you will get later.</li>

	<li><b>Skills: </b> using a similar system to the Special abilities, the Skills too have a slot based system,
	which you can use to buy narrow or broad skills. Narrow skills (since the are limited) cost only one slot
	while the broad skill (being a collection of multiple narrow skills) cost 2 slots.
	Getting a +2 in the stats you obtain 2 skill slots, while getting the +4 grants you 2 slots.</li>

	<li><b>Inability: </b>accepting to get inability in a skill will grant you another skill slot.
	You can do this "conversion" only twice, granting you two extra slots</li>
